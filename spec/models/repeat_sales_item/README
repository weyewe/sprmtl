in this repeat sales item, we are simulating the case where sales item is repeat.

Means: same customer, different sales order, same template sales item. Difference: quantity
price


We want to simulate these things:
1. Repeat Sales Item with different service level. 
		a. In sales_order #1, it requires production only 
		b. In sales_order #2, it requires production + post_production  
			# if there is delivery made, those items already sent must go through new sales_order 
			# ah, one way: cancel delivery.. and bring those item back 
		
		c. Impossible case. must be blocked => from post_production only => production + post_production
		
		
2. Effect on  
	a. SubcriptionProductionHistory, SubcriptionPostProductionHistory  in the case with no changes
				in the service level
				
	b. If there is changes in service level  ( try case 1b ) 
	
3. Loose Delivery: you can just send out any items. 
		 # so , if it is only at production. But the customer wants to rush it up..
		# send it while it is in production, reduce the pending post production ... hheheh! 
		# mark the loose delivery entry => to peg the pending post_production
